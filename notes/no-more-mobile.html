        <article class="wrap post-content">

            <h3>In this industry, we speak a specialist language; some terms and phrases are firmly embedded in our craft, whilst new ones emerge daily.</h3>

<hr />

<p>It&#8217;s important that we understand each other, collaboration is common, whether its designer to developer, client to supplier or agency to freelancer.</p>

<p>One term that really confuses me each time it&#8217;s used is &#8216;Mobile&#8217;.</p>

<hr />

<h4>What do we mean by Mobile?</h4>

<p>Sounds obvious right! But the thing is, you can&#8217;t be <strong>100% certain</strong> what someone means when they say &#8216;Mobile&#8217;.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;Let&#8217;s use a Mobile first approach&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;It needs to be Mobile friendly&#8221;</em> </li>
<li><em>&#8220;We need to think about Mobile users&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Are they talking about device type, small screens, low bandwidth, device capabilities or people in the park?</p>

<hr />

<h4>Do we mean context?</h4>

<p>Is the term &#8216;Mobile&#8217; solely reserved for a user&#8217;s context - people accessing the web whilst they&#8217;re on the move?</p>

<p>The pioneers of &#8216;Mobile&#8217; had context in mind when they set out to deliver a tailored experience for mobile users - designing products for specific scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>User:</strong> &#8220;Whilst I&#8217;m waiting for my train I&#8217;ll look at that engagement ring I saw on Tiffany and Co, last night.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Website:</strong> &#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re on a mobile phone, you must want a map and directions to our nearest store.&#8221;</p>

<p>This approach changed when mobile web browsing increased and we realised that users wanted the &#8216;normal internet&#8217;.</p>

<p>Luke Wroblewski sums it up nicely&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What was formerly becoming the “mobile context” is becoming increasingly difficult to define. Context can’t predict the way a user is going to use the site. Mind reading is no way to base fundamental content decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h4>Do we mean Mobile web?</h4>

<p>The term &#8216;Mobile Web&#8217; emerged when there was a need to differentiate between the web on a Mobile device and the web on a Desktop device. We referred to this as &#8216;The Gap&#8217;, and approached each side differently.</p>

<p>Then we learnt that users expect to see the same content regardless of what device they accessed it on. Since realising our mistakes with context-based design decisions, we&#8217;ve put features and content back in to products. </p>

<p>The gap has now closed. Some users probably never even had an awareness of the gap and when we (the designers) look back and reflect on this era, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll conclude that it was us that opened the gap in the first place.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Do we mean Mobile Phone?</h4>

<p>More often than not, when people say &#8216;Mobile&#8217;, they mean Mobile Phone - wrapped-up as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Small Screen</li>
<li>Handheld</li>
<li>Touch Input</li>
<li>Device features - camera, geo-location.</li>
</ul>

<p>But these attributes aren&#8217;t exclusive to mobile phones. </p>

<p>What about tablets? They have small screens, they&#8217;re handheld and they&#8217;re touch enabled. What about tablets with keyboards, or phones with keyboards for that matter?</p>

<p>We&#8217;re comfortable using the word &#8216;Mobile&#8217; to mean mobile phone, but if you mean mobile phone say it. Better still, say smartphone, cellphone or iPhone if that&#8217;s what you <em>really</em> mean.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Do we mean small screen?</h4>

<p>A lot of people use &#8216;Mobile&#8217; when referring to small screens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you done the mobile stylesheet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s use a &#8216;Mobile first&#8217; approach&#8221; translates to &#8220;start with 320px wireframes&#8221; or &#8220;use min-width media queries&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>&#8216;Mobile&#8217; isn&#8217;t synonymous with small screens anymore.</strong></p>

<p>Smartphones are getting bigger. Tablets are getting smaller.</p>

<p>Some smartphones have a resolution of 800px, some tablets upto 1280px. These are &#8216;Mobile devices&#8217;, yet most people would say a 1280px screen sits firmly in the desktop camp.</p>

<p>Drawing the line between device groups has become complicated, as Jason Grigsby explains in <a href="https://blog.cloudfour.com/responsive-design-for-apps-part-1/">his article</a> on the Cloud 4 blog.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the issue that &#8216;small&#8217; is a relative term. When does a screen become &#8216;small&#8217;? If Apple release the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/10/apple-iwatch-curved-glass/">iWatch</a> do we call these screens &#8216;Super-Small&#8217;?</p>

<p>What about Daddy, Mummy, and Baby screens? It sounds ridiculous but it&#8217;s more clear than &#8216;Mobile&#8217;.</p>

<hr />

<h4>We should stop using the term.</h4>

<p>Mobile was a useful term when it was new and niche. You could use it in a conversation to narrow things down. Now it&#8217;s so broad it&#8217;s fast becoming meaningless.</p>

<p>Mobile Users will become &#8216;Users&#8217;, Mobile Web will become &#8216;Web&#8217;, and they&#8217;ll be so many devices in so many sizes that deciding what to ring fence as a Mobile device will become impossible. I&#8217;d argue that it already is. </p>

<p><strong>Not convinced?</strong> Well this news popped up today, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-blends-desktop-and-mobile-ads-2013-2">&#8216;Google just blasted away the wall between Desktop and Mobile Ads&#8217;</a>, which is a big indicator to change.</p>

<hr />

<h4>New words please.</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s important that we understand each other, crossed wires can lead to project delays and even financial penalties.</p>

<p>Mobile has become a buzzword, we should bite our tongue the next time it spills out of our mouths. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s try using other words to narrow down what we actually mean.</p>

<p><strong>When we mean context</strong><br />
- Less engaged users<br />
- Location based tasks</p>

<p><strong>When we mean device type</strong><br />
- smartphones<br />
- handheld devices<br />
- portable devices</p>

<p><strong>When we mean screen size</strong><br />
- Small screens<br />
- Low res screens<br />
- Narrow viewports</p>

<p><em>These are off the top of my head - <strong>what are your suggestions?</strong></em></p>
