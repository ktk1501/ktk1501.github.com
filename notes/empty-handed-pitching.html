            <h3>Turning up to a pitch with nothing to show enables you more opportunity to explain what you&#8217;re capable of doing, and offers the client a better experience.</h3>

<hr />

<p>It&#8217;s still common practice for agencies, studios and freelancers to roll up to a pitch and present concepts. Clients revel in this scenario, treating it like an X-factor audition - wrapping up meetings with &#8220;thanks, we&#8217;ll let you know&#8221;.</p>

<p>Pitching concepts might be cemented into your process, but it&#8217;s better for the client if you don&#8217;t show them anything. </p>

<p>To understand <em>why</em>, put yourself <strong>in the customer&#8217;s shoes</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h4>The problem with the &#8216;big reveal&#8217;.</h4>

<p>Picture this&#8230; you walk into a Michelin Star restaurant and the head chef approaches you with a plate of food.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Here you go, I knew you were coming so I made you this.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>They hand you a steaming plate of Grilled Octopus with braised Giant White Beans, grilled Frisee and a Saffron Aioli (posh sauce).</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t really know what you wanted, but most people like this dish.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Now, this Chef is amazing in the Kitchen, they can create anything (it&#8217;s why you booked 2 months in advance!), yet right now you&#8217;re probably looking at the plate of food thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is great! I&#8217;ve only just walked in and I&#8217;ve already seen/smelt an example of their cuisine.</li>
<li>Hmm, now that I&#8217;ve seen this dish I really want to try it and can&#8217;t think about eating anything else. </li>
<li>Damn, I feel obliged to eat this after they&#8217;ve gone through all that effort.</li>
<li>Ah ha, I wonder if they&#8217;ll charge me less if I eat this, it&#8217;s only going in the bin otherwise.</li>
<li>Ergh, Octopus!</li>
</ul>

<p>It might be amazing food, but has the Chef delivered you the best they could? They don&#8217;t know how hungry you are, or if you intend to eat 2, 3, or 4 courses?</p>

<hr />

<h4>Insightful conversation</h4>

<p>Now imagine walking into the same restaurant, being seated at your table and a few minutes later the Chef joins you.</p>

<ul>
<li>They spend 5 minutes talking with you about the types of food you like.</li>
<li>They tell you about the ingredients they use and where they source them from.</li>
<li>They explain about the specialist cooking techniques they use.</li>
<li>They bring out some things for you to try. </li>
<li>They ask what you don&#8217;t like eating.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Chef goes back into the kitchen armed with lots of information about you to create a unique dish to match your tastes.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you feel like you were getting more value from their skills and expertise?</p>

<hr />

<h4>Make an impression</h4>

<p>Pitches aren&#8217;t for talking about your process and services (your site should do that), or for presenting a mockup that you spent a day on. They&#8217;re opportunities to get to know the client, talk about the project, and demonstrate your expertise. </p>

<p>Go in to the situation confidently, like you&#8217;re already working on the project. Ask questions, learn about them and speak about your own experiences. They&#8217;ll get more insight into who you are, how you work and what you&#8217;re capable of.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t risk serving up the wrong dish. Give them a taste and leave them wanting more. </p>

<p><em>Food for thought.</em></p>
